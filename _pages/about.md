Hi, I’m a physician-scientist interested in understanding how recurrent genomic rearrangements impact oncogene regulation in cancer to sustain unlimited growth. 
To study these questions, I will lead a laboratory at the Charité Institute of Pathology supported by a Max Eder grant from the German Cancer Aid. 
Currently, I am a fellow of the BIH Charité Junior Clinician Scientist Program working with [Anton Henssen](https://henssenlab.com/). 
Previously I was a postdoc in the lab of [Rameen Beroukhim](https://beroukhimlab.org/) at the Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
If you are interested in studying how recurrent genomic rearrangements impact oncogene regulation in cancer and are passionate about biomedical research let me know! Always looking for enthusiastic new labmembers at several levels (PhD and MD students, postdocs or MSci students)
