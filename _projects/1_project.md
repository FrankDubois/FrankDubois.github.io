Most cancer genomes experience DNA amplifications as the most common gain-of-function alterations leading to overexpression of oncogenes. 

Why does this work? 
How does the transcriptional regulation of the oncogenes get hijacked on these amplifications? 
Do they exploit tissue-specific enhancers and transcription factors for oncogene expression and cancer growth? 

We combine whole genome sequencing of hundreds of breast and lung cancers including long-read and epigenetic analyses with validation of our findings using CRISPR-based genome engineering to answer these questions. 

Understanding which regulatory factors are essential for cancer growth could lead to novel tissue-specific gene regulation targeting therapies.

The coding sequences of the oncogenes are only a small fraction of the amplified DNA. Why are the cancer cells keeping 50+ copies of the rest? Are there essential regulatory elements in these co-amplified regions?

The plot shows two loci on chromosome 2 with the positions of the coding sequences of the MYCN and ID2 genes highlighted in blue and orange respectively.

To answer these questions we will analyze a several hundert breast and lung cancer tumor samples by whole genome sequencing including with long-read technology.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:
